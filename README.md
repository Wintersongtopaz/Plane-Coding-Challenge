In this challenge I learned more on how to debuge. Before the plane was going backwards, going too fast, tilting automatically, the propeller does not spin. The camera was in front of the plane, not following the plane. (From Unity learn: Create with Code - Challenge 1) 

Challenge Outcome:
- The plane moves forward at a constant rate
- The up/down arrows tilt the nose of the plane up and down
- The camera follows along beside the plane as it flies
